                           ===============

crashlogd is a daemon intended to track device state, up-time and
crashes. Collected data is tracked in '/data/logs/history_event' file
with one line per logged event. If level of information does not fit
this format, a dedicated folder per event is created and tracked in
the history_event file. Created folder contains metadata, AP logs and
event specific files.

Collected data come from different components :
 - AP logs, from ap_logfs service (logcat to /data/logs/aplog)
 - Android framework, mainly dropbox (/data/system/dropbox)
 - Panic and watchdogs logs, from pstore and other drivers
 - Modem logs and events from MMGR library
 - Our own framework which could collect events from kernel,
   user-space using different APIs : inotify, LCT/KCT.

Produced data could be consumed by embedded tools (Phone Doctor, MPM)
or host tools (MPTA, ACS). Those tools could upload data to crashtool
server (http://crashtool.tl.intel.com) for post-mortem analysis.
