                             debug-logs
                             ==========

debug-logs group provides file system logging. This allows to collect
logs from Android continuously. This feature is mandatory to catch
bugs in stabilisation phase where they are more spurious and do not
always trigger crashes. It is also valuable to
eMTB/MTBF/SST/DSP/dogfooding users for post-mortem analysis.

Associated service is 'ap_logfs', which executes logcat to
continuously flush all Android logs to file. If it is not started at
boot, do it manually :
 # start ap_logfs

Logs file is available at '/data/logs/aplog'.


Debug only mixins consideration
-------------------------------

This feature is part of 'debug-*' groups, which are dedicated to debug
and product stabilisation, thus do not target final products and user
builds.

As per build variant (eng, userdebug, user) dedicated files feature is
not available with mixins, per option files are provided in
'device/intel/common/debug/' folder and will be included at build time
regarding selected option.
